Dockutils
=========

Dockutils is a collection of scripts providing an infrastructure to easily
trigger actions on docking/undocking requests for different laptops and
vendors.

dockhandler: This is the central point to start. Either the command line
tool docking or an acpi event coming from the acpid daemon will execute
this script.

Provided infrastructure
=======================

docker: Command line tool to trigger dock/undock requests.

hooks: Directory containing the different hooks for different vendor
       laptops.

hooks/thinkpad: Directory containing hooks for all Thinkpads (ibm)
		notebooks. These hooks are triggered either through an
		acpid event or when a Thinkpad model is found and docker
		is used. Every Thinkpad has to use ibm_acpi for docking,
		so theres one hook 50generic which does the ibm_acpi
		handling.

hooks/misc: Different scripts for laptops which don't have anything
	    common.
